# py-visualize
a python program to visualize the frequency of the sound of a WAVE file

this program expects to find a WAVE file in sys.argv[1], so to execute from the command line, 
I would use something like this:

  python3 fftSoundVisualizerStereo.py audio/song.wav
  
Where fftSoundVisualizer is the script and audio is a local directory that contains some stereo wav file.
